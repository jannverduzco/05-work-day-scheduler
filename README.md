# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This work day scheduler gives the user a 9 hour scheduling organizer. It starts at 9AM and ends at 5PM. This scheduler allows the  user input a description, for each time block, of the task needed to be executed  that day. The user can also save the task (clicking the blue button) in the local storege therefore if that page is closed or refreshed, the task will be stored and displayed for the user. 

This work day scheduler is color coded to make it more appealing and helpful to the eye. The time blocks in grey represent the past time hours of the current day. The pastel red time 'block' represents the current hour of the day. And the green time blocks represent the future/upcoming hours for that currenty day.
